## Electrophysiology data
![Data peek](https://github.com/rahulvenugopal/Viz_Others/blob/master/Electrophysiology/data_head.png)
Data looked like this

There were three groups. Electrophysiology parameter was measured every 30 seconds
This data came from multiple slices from multiple animals

Typically this is the way many researchers plot
![Horrible plot](https://github.com/rahulvenugopal/Viz_Others/blob/master/Electrophysiology/horrible_plot.jpg)

Weird graphing softwares add their horrible palettes with meshes
If there are 4 groups or plus, the entire visualisations gets muddy :weary:

Enter seaborn + matplotlib
